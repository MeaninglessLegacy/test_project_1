random room layout generator  
creates a 2 dimensional layout of rooms and hallways of random size  
The process starts by generating a series of random sized rooms within an area. Then seperating each of the rooms that overlap through flocking behaviour. After all rooms are seperated create a spanning tree through triangulation by an incremental algorithm. Connecting the rooms using a minimum spanning tree.
